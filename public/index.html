        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p>
          I have ~5 years experince as a fullstack developer, mainly Reactjs/Nextjs, Nodejs/Nextjs and Mongodb.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a mindset of getting the job done, whether by myslef or with a team.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm familiar with a startup environment with fast pace but also quality of work is guaranteed. That's achieved by applying design patterns, unit testing, code review and Typescript.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I am a person who has a firm belief in decentralized systems as it has many applications that could change the world.
